# Bot
    - Bots send hearbeats to the orchestrator
    - On bot start, ask orchestrator for a client-id, use this for all
      communication with orch

# Orchestrator
    - On new bot join:
        - Try to rebalance channels between all bots to include the new one
    - High Availability?
        - Assign multiple bots to a single channel & use the msg-id as an
          idempotency key on consumers
        - Rebalancing:
            - Add channel to another bot before leaving channel on another
              (We'd rather have extra messages than miss some)

# Considerations
    - We need to have some form of weightings or metrics to say how many
      messages a bot is processing so we know how to balance channels between bots
    - Where are we storing the orch data so it's not just in-memory?
    - gRPC channel back to each client?
